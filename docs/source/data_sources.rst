*****************************************
Overview of Sources of Archived Web Pages
*****************************************

The EDGI Website Monitoring project currently ingests data from three sources:

* Internet Archive Wayback Machine
* Versionista (legacy)

Internet Archive
================

The Internet Archive Wayback Machine stores snapshots of HTML pages. The
Internet Archive at large stores a broader range of archived content, but we
are focused on the Wayback Machine.


The original response from the Internet Archive is a list of 'mementos' (or
'versions', as we call them). Each line contains information about a version. At
times, a line may be a 'TimeMap', which is essentially a link to the next list
of mementos.


`source_metadata` : Byte sequences containing information separated by semi-colons of each version stored in Internet Archive.
We extract the useful information i.e. the date and uri from each memento.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    b'<http://web.archive.org/web/19970711094601/http://www.nasa.gov:80/>; rel="memento"; datetime="Fri, 11 Jul 1997 09:46:01 GMT",'
